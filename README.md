## üë©üèª‚ÄçüöÄ Projects  

### PhD Thesis ‚û°Ô∏è DFT calculations in the study of mixed oxides: Structure, properties, and applications in the hydrogen economy  

**What I Did:**
I studied advanced oxide materials using computational chemistry to explore their applications in green hydrogen production and fuel cells. I combined simulations with experimental work to gain insights into material behavior.

**Highlights:**
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted complex DFT calculations to reveal relationships between structure and properties.
- **Problem Solving:** Developed models to explain photocatalytic efficiency and ion mobility in fuel cells.
- **Automation:** Created Python scripts to expedite data processing and analysis.
- **Communication:** Summarized findings using clear visualizations for publications and presentations.
- **Learning Agility:** Mastered new computational techniques and software throughout the project.

### Renewable Energy Project ‚û°Ô∏è Energy & Evolution: A story through data

**What I did:**  
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing the historical relationship between human evolution and energy consumption, from fire to renewable sources. The project combines historical data with energy trends to tell a compelling story of how energy has driven human progress.

**Tools:** Tableau, Data Visualization, Storytelling

**Highlights:**  
- **Data Analysis:** Processed and analyzed historical energy consumption data.  
- **Storytelling:** Crafted a narrative that connects human milestones with energy usage.  
- **Data Visualization:** Designed interactive dashboards to engage users and convey insights
